## Competitors

For the competitor methods analyzed during our experimental evaluation, we used the implementations from PyOD when possible, namely for
- KNN
- LOF
- CBLOF
- Isolation Forest
- PCA
- DeepSVDD
- OCSVM
- LODA
- HBOS
- COPOD
- ECOD
- SOD
- VAE

For some some additional methods we used implementations by Victor Livernoche <vlivernoche@gmail.com> or own implementations (as provided in this folder), namely for
- Autoencoder
- DAGMM 
- GOAD
- Normalizing Flow

Finally, for NeuTral and DTE we used the official implementations, namely https://github.com/boschresearch/NeuTraL-AD and https://github.com/vicliv/DTE.

For the experiments we generally referred to the default parameterization proposed in the respective implementations.
