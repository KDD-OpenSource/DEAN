## Competitors

For the competitor methods analyzed during our experimental evaluation, we used the implementations from PyOD when possible, namely for
- x
- x

For some some additional methods we used implementations by Victor Livernoche <vlivernoche@gmail.com>, namely for
- x
- x

Finally, for NeuTral and DTE we used the official implementations, namely https://github.com/boschresearch/NeuTraL-AD and https://github.com/vicliv/DTE.

For the experiments we generally referred to the default parameterization provided in the respective implementations.
